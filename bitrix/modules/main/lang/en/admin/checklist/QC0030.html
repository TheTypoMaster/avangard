<p>The custom components in your web project should have clear and unambiguous
parameters that can be configured by administrators without the developer's
help.</p>

<p>Assume among other 30 components you have created for your website there is
one to show a list of registered members: "myproject:members.list". What
parameters would this component have? This depends, of course, on the nature of
the website and usage scenarios. The most common settings an administrator would
expect from a component of this intent are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Members per page (to set the number of members currently visible on a
  webpage);</li>
<li>Short / long name (to set the person name format; two radio buttons or a
  drop-down list);</li> 
<li>Maximum description length (to set the maximum number of characters visible);</li> 
<li>Show e-mail address (checkbox);</li>
<li>Sort list by (to set the sort column);</li> 
<li>some other component specific parameters.</li>
 </ul>

<p>However, it is most likely that an administrator (expecting him or her being
a programmer is a common mistake) will get confused seeing parameters like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Caching strategy;</li>
<li>JSON request format;</li> 
<li>Authorized user groups (meaning to select the user groups that are allowed
  to view the component output).</li> 
 </ul>

<p>If you think such parameters are still required for some reason, isolate them
into a group (by the name of "Advanced settings" or something like
that) and describe in the website specifications.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the settings sheet of each of the custom components in your
    website's public section. Make sure each of the parameters and options has a
    clear title and is well documented. The parameter names should give an
    administrator a quick understanding of the parameter meaning and possible
    values. It is wise to check each of the parameters to ensure they behave as
    expected.</li>
</ul>
