Respect the checklist recommendations to achieve the best performance, security and control of your web project, and reduce technological risks and maintenance cost.</p> <p>The recommendations are embodied in the tests consisting of the two groups: mandatory and optional. The mandatory tests are qualitatively critical and must be passed. The optional tests may and will improve the final project quality. It is recommended that your project pass these tests as well. Some tests are automatic.</p> <p>The project is ready for release if the checklist nodes are showing green.</p> <p>Use the following sequence to prepare a project for release.</p> <ol>   <li>The developer starts autotesting. The system runs test one by one and marks each autotest as passed or failed.</li> <li>The developer checks each of the failed autotests, fixes problems and restarts the failed autotest. The test can be marked as skipped manually.</li> <li>The developer checks each of the manual test and marks them as \"passed\" or \"skipped\".</li>   <li>The developer provides his or her personal and company information in the appropriate checklist branch.</li>   <li>The developer delivers the project to the Customer. The latter ensures all the mandatory tests have been passed and no such tests have been skipped.</li>   <li>The developer releases the project and adds it to the archive.</li> </ol> <p>Any subsequent major update should be released as a separate project using the quality control checklist.
